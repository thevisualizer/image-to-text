# image-to-text
Image to text can be integrated into a variety of applications and can convert images in popular formats such as JPEG, JPG, PNG, and GIF into editable text. 

To use OCR for image to text conversion, the first step is to select the image you want to process. The image should be of high quality, with good lighting and contrast, and should be in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, JPG, PNG, or GIF). Once you have selected the image, you can open it in the OCR <a href="https://rapidapi.com/hakimiachraf841/api/ocr-image-to-text4">Image to text</a> API, and the program will automatically analyze the image and extract the text.
